                <img src="images/classic.png" alt="Classic Teddy Bear">

                <p>The teddy bear has been a beloved symbol of childhood and comfort for well over a century.  Its origins trace back to 1902 when President Theodore"Teddy" Roosevelt famously spared a bear during a hunting trip in Mississippi.  The story made headlines, inspiring a political cartoon and catching th eattention of a Brookly shopkeeper who crafted a plush bear and displayed it as "Teddy's bear."  The name stuck, and the teddy bear was born, a gentle toy that would soon find its way into nurseries, gift boxes, and hearts around the globe.</p>
                <p>From that first handmade bear to today's vast world of plush companions, teddy bears have remained a timeless gift.  They cross generations and cultures, passed from grandparents to grandchildren, collected by hobbyists, cherished by children who whisper secrets to them at bedtime.  some bears become keepsakes that travel the world with their owners, appearing in family photos for decades.</p>
                <p>At Teddy Bears, we believe every bear should bring warmth, joy, and a sense of safety.  Our team carefully designs and curates a wide variety of bears, from traditional stitched brown bears to modern, themed, and seasonal bears for holidays and special occasions.  Each bear is crafted with premium materials, soft fabrics, and attention to detail that makes it feel truly one of a kind.</p>
                <p>We work with dedicated artisans and trusted manufacturers to ensure every seam is sturdy, every paw is plush, and every nose is perfectly stitched.

                <p>But our story doesn't end with the bears themselves. We believe in building memories.
